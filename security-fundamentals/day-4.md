# Cybersecurity Day 4 – IoT, Big Data & Security Principles

## Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a large network of physical objects such as sensors, software, and other equipment that are connected to the internet and exchange data.

## IoT and Big Data
IoT has led to exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business known as **Big Data**.

## McCumber Cube
The McCumber Cube is a cybersecurity framework created by John McCumber in 1991.  
It helps organizations establish and evaluate information security by considering different dimensions of protection.

## Foundational Principles of Information Security
Information security is based on core principles used to protect data and systems.

### Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized people or systems.

Methods used to achieve confidentiality include:
- Data encryption
- Identity proofing
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Access controls

## Key Takeaway
Modern cybersecurity involves protecting data across devices, networks, and systems while applying strong security principles.

 ##  CIA Triad (Integrity & Availability)

## Integrity
Integrity ensures that system information, data, and processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification.

Security controls used to maintain integrity include:
- Hash functions
- Checksums
- Digital signatures
- Access controls

These methods help verify that data has not been altered without authorization.

## Availability
Availability ensures that authorized users can access systems and data when needed.

Availability is maintained by:
- Regular system maintenance
- Hardware repairs
- Keeping systems and software up to date
- Creating and testing backups
- Redundancy and failover systems

The goal is to minimize downtime and ensure continuous access.

## CIA Triad Overview
The CIA Triad represents the three core principles of information security:
- **Confidentiality** – Prevents unauthorized access to data
- **Integrity** – Prevents unauthorized data modification
- **Availability** – Ensures reliable access to systems and data

## Key Takeaway
All cybersecurity strategies are built around maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems.
